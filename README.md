**#Project Name: Pipeline Building Exercise**
This project is to create a pipeline where we are downloading the 26 csv files from a S3 Repo.
After that we created various dataframes for the 26 files, then pivoted the dataframes in the desired format.
Then merged every datarame into one final dataframe and then generated a csv file of that to view it in Excel or Sheets.

**##Installation and Usage steps:**
1.For installtion you will need to have Anaconda instance on your local machine set up.
2.You can go to the code section and then download the raw .ipynb extension file.
3.After that it will appear in your downloads folder on local machine. 
4.You can run there directly buy opening the correct path on Jupyter notebooks via Anaconda.
5.But I highly recommend to create a folder in desired directory or desktop, move the .ipynb file there.
6.Go to the Anaconda instance and go to the correct path to the newly created folder.
7. Open the .ipynb file it should be named WIW_Exercise.ipynb
8. Make sure the ananconda kernel is connected
Note:
9. There is this path being used in the code which is from my local machine 
  path = "C:/Users/biran/Desktop/When I Work Challenge/"+str(char)+".csv"
  You will have to change this to the desired folder of your destination and make sure you the back slaches to forward slashes to run error free
